project question 

Alice and Bob run an online shop. Their business operates using a single website on their on-premises server. Their system uses one single server that runs the webserver on Apache and MySQL. Most of their customers are US and Canada based. 

Recently, they suffered from a power outage and their website went down for a few hours. According to their estimation, the impact of that outage was about 1M dollar in lost revenue. 

Now Alice and Bob are thinking about moving to the cloud, but they donâ€™t have the expertise to do that migration. They hired you to provide recommendations on how their website will run on the cloud. 

 Design a simple network diagram to deploy the future website on the Azure cloud.
